## About Me

Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a Frontend Developer building high-performance websites for small businesses and professionals. My transition to the world of web development began in 2023, when I decided I needed a website to showcase my writing. At some point I realized I liked the coding more than the writing, and the rest is history. Since then I've focussed on building high-performance sites with a Lean Web approach in order to create light but powerful websites that are built to last.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

```js
const skills = {
  languages: ["Semantic HTML", "modern CSS", "JavaScript"],
  frameworks: ["Astro", "Eleventy"],

}
```
