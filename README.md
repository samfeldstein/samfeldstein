Hi, I'm Sam! I'm a Frontend Developer building high-performance websites for small businesses and professionals.

## About Me

My transition to the world of web development began in 2023, when I decided I needed a website to showcase my writing. At some point I realized I liked the coding more than the writing, and the rest is history. Since then I've focussed on building high-performance sites with a Lean Web approach in order to create light but powerful websites that are built to last.

## Technical Skills 

- Languages: Semantic HTML, modern CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks: Astro, Eleventy
- Web performance: Proficient in modern web performance optimization methods including static site generation, modern image formats, font-loading strategies, CDN caching, component architecture, and service workers.

## Projects

- [Danceophile Studio](https://danceophile.com): A complete rebuild of a legacy website into a modern, performant static site using Astro.
- [Prairie Rose Arena](https://prairierosearena.com): A high-performance static site for an equestrian event center in Iowa. Built with Eleventy.
- [Personal Site](https://samfeldstein.xyz): My personal site, built with Astro. Highly optimized to achieve sub-second load times and 95+ Lighthouse scores.
